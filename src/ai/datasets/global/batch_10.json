    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is a die-to-die interconnect fabric?",
      "answer": "A die-to-die interconnect fabric is a communication interface that enables high-bandwidth, low-latency data exchange between chiplets within a package."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "How does micro-bump resistance impact signal quality?",
      "answer": "High resistance increases IR drop, degrades signal edges, and can reduce bandwidth, especially in high-speed chiplet-to-chiplet links."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is a semi-additive process (SAP) for substrates?",
      "answer": "SAP is a fine-line fabrication method where thin seed layers are plated to define narrow metal lines and spaces, enabling HDI substrate routing."

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is a GaN gate charge, and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Gate charge determines how quickly a transistor can switch; GaN devices have low gate charge, enabling high-frequency, low-loss operation."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is dielectric absorption in packaging materials?",
      "answer": "Dielectric absorption occurs when materials retain a portion of an electric charge, affecting signal behavior in high-speed and RF designs."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why are ground shields used in high-frequency packages?",
      "answer": "Ground shields reduce electromagnetic coupling, improving isolation and signal integrity in RF, mmWave, and high-speed digital circuits."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What causes copper pumping in solder joints?",
      "answer": "Copper pumping occurs when thermal cycling induces vertical movement of copper pillars or traces, stressing the solder and potentially causing fatigue cracks."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is thermal gradient-induced stress?",
      "answer": "Thermal gradients create uneven expansion across a package, generating mechanical stress that can lead to warpage or delamination."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why are glass substrates advantageous for RF designs?",
      "answer": "Glass substrates offer low dielectric loss and excellent uniformity, improving attenuation and phase stability at high frequencies."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
           "question": "What is conductive filament formation?",
      "answer": "Conductive filament formation is a failure mechanism where metal ions migrate through dielectrics under electrical stress, eventually creating a short circuit."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why is coefficient of hygroscopic expansion (CHE) important?",
      "answer": "CHE measures how much a material expands when absorbing moisture. High CHE can increase stress during reflow and contribute to delamination."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is the purpose of thermal interface materials in high-power modules?",
      "answer": "Thermal interface materials fill microscopic gaps between surfaces to reduce thermal resistance and improve heat dissipation from power devices."
