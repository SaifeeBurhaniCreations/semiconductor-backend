    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why are polymer dielectrics used in RDL layers?",
      "answer": "Polymers offer flexibility, low dielectric constants, and compatibility with fine-line patterning, making them suitable for multi-layer RDL construction."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is mechanical compliance in interconnects?",
      "answer": "Mechanical compliance refers to an interconnect’s ability to absorb strain without cracking, critical for reliability during thermal cycling or board flexing."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What causes solder void formation?",
      "answer": "Voids can form due to flux residues, trapped gas, insufficient wetting, or poor material flow, reducing thermal and electrical performance."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is dielectric breakdown?",
      "answer": "Dielectric breakdown occurs when an insulating material can no longer withstand electric field stress, resulting in current leakage or failure."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why is outgassing a concern in packaging materials?",
      "answer": "Outgassing releases trapped gases that can cause voids, corrosion, or contamination during high-temperature assembly processes."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is a package’s thermal impedance?",
      "answer": "Thermal impedance describes a package’s dynamic thermal behavior, accounting for both steady-state resistance and transient thermal response."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why are coefficient of moisture expansion (CME) values important?",
      "answer": "Materials with high CME absorb water and expand, increasing stress during reflow and contributing to delamination or popcorning failures."
