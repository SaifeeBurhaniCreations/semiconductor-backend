    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is the purpose of underfill in flip-chip packaging?",
      "answer": "Underfill increases mechanical strength, redistributes stress, and improves thermal cycling reliability by filling the gap between the die and substrate around solder bumps."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why are micro-bumps used in high-density interconnects?",
      "answer": "Micro-bumps enable fine-pitch connections between chiplets or dies, supporting high I/O counts and short interconnect lengths for high-bandwidth applications."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is a fan-out package?",
      "answer": "A fan-out package redistributes die pads outward using RDL layers, enabling larger I/O counts without needing a silicon interposer."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What role does a silicon interposer play in 2.5D packaging?",
      "answer": "A silicon interposer provides a dense, low-loss wiring layer between multiple dies, enabling high-bandwidth connections such as HBM-to-logic links."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is warpage in advanced packaging?",
      "answer": "Warpage refers to deformation of a package or substrate due to thermal stress or material mismatches. Excessive warpage affects assembly alignment and long-term reliability."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why is thermal interface material (TIM) important in power modules?",
      "answer": "TIM reduces the thermal resistance between power devices and heat spreaders, ensuring efficient heat transfer and improved reliability under high load conditions."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What makes SiC suitable for automotive inverters?",
      "answer": "SiC offers high switching efficiency, low conduction loss, and high-temperature operation, which reduces inverter size, weight, and cooling requirements in EV systems."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is a double-sided cooling structure in power modules?",
      "answer": "Double-sided cooling attaches heat spreaders to both the top and bottom of power dies, significantly improving thermal dissipation and power density."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What are the benefits of GaN in high-frequency applications?",
      "answer": "GaN’s high electron mobility and fast switching speed allow efficient power conversion at high frequencies, reducing magnetics size and improving power density."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "Why are glass interposers attractive for RF and mmWave packaging?",
      "answer": "Glass offers low dielectric loss, excellent flatness, and stable material properties, enabling high-performance signal integrity at mmWave frequencies."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What are the challenges of using glass substrates in packaging?",
      "answer": "Challenges include via formation, CTE matching, handling fragility, and integrating multi-layer RDL structures without cracking or warping."
    },

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "What is heterogeneous power module integration?",
      "answer": "Heterogeneous integration combines SiC or GaN dies with drivers, sensors, and control ICs within one module to reduce parasitics, size, and system-level losses."
